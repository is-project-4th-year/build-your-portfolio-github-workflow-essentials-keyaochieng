## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes 😅).  
For each one, mention:

- What you thought it would be like **(Expectation 👀)**  
- What you actually learned **(Reality 😅)**  
- And how it helped with your personal portfolio project **💻**

---

### 🧠 What I Thought I’d Learn vs What I Actually Learned

**1. Concept: Branching**  
**Expectation 👀**: I assumed branching was mostly meant for large teams working on complex software projects.  
**Reality 😅**: I realized branching is also extremely useful for solo projects. It helped me safely test changes without interfering with the main code.  
**Impact 💡**: I used feature branches to develop new sections like the contact form, then merged them cleanly into the main branch after testing.

**2. Concept: Rebasing**  
**Expectation 👀**: I thought rebasing was just a fancy alternative to merging that I wouldn’t need to bother with.  
**Reality 😅**: I learned that rebasing can make my commit history cleaner and more readable by applying my changes on top of the latest version of the main branch.  
**Impact 💡**: I used rebasing to update my feature branches with the latest changes from main, especially when switching between different features during development.

**3. Concept: Commits**  
**Expectation 👀**: I expected committing to just be a way to save my work, without much structure.  
**Reality 😅**: I discovered that clear, focused commits are essential for tracking changes and troubleshooting. Writing good commit messages also makes collaboration easier.  
**Impact 💡**: I made sure each commit reflected one task (like “add about section”) so I could go back and understand my progress clearly.

**4. Concept: Merge Conflicts**  
**Expectation 👀**: I didn’t expect to face merge conflicts since I was working alone.  
**Reality 😅**: I encountered a few merge conflicts when switching branches and rebasing. It was confusing at first but became easier as I understood how Git works behind the scenes.  
**Impact 💡**: Learning how to resolve conflicts helped me stay calm and confident when things didn’t go smoothly—and I avoided losing work.

**Caption**: This shows the different branches I used to develop portfolio features separately.

### D. Pull Requests
